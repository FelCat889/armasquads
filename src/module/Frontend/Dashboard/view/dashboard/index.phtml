        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            As i moved this project to a new and more powerful server, i migrated Armasquads<br />
            to run inside an docker enviroment. During the migration i also found some bugs<br />
            that maybe prevented that some uploaded squad logos to get successfully converted<br />
            into an ArmA paa files and therefore not displayed ingame.<br />
            <br />
            So if you had logo problems in the past, please give it a new try.
            <br />

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            Today i <b>removed the ads</b>. <br />
            <br />
            The SSL Certs are paid for 3 years from the donations and in the meantime <a target="_blank" href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt.org</a> is now a Trusted CA authority. \o/<br />
            So I can get the next SSL Certs from them - for Zero, Nada, Null, Nix - awesome.<br />
            <br />
            I'm thankfully that the remaining server costs are fully covered by donations.<br />
            <br />
            And I would like to thank everyone who donated and spend a few bucks to help keeping this project alive.<br />
            <br />

        <div class="panel-body">
            As you might allready see - today i added ads on this website. It is a hard step as i hate ads at all but i
            will try to explain why i take this changes.<br />
            <br />
            Armasquads.com is now ~1 year online and is growing every day. I love to see how this project went from a
            small side project to something bigger and to a tool that is usefull for so many awesome squads/users.<br />
            <br />
            I don't want to make profit out of this project but i would love to achieve that the monthly costs, to
            running this project, are covered.<br />

            In this one year i received 8 donations. I would like to thank here the following people:<br />
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Florian N. (9,31 $)</li>
                <li>Dennis V. (4,99 $)</li>
                <li>Lukas L. (1,3 $)</li>
                <li>Thijs G. (5 $)</li>
                <li>Aleksandra K. (2,84 $)</li>
                <li>Rico Z. (4,99 $)</li>
                <li>Matthias R. (10,38 $)</li>
                <li>David B. (9,31 $)</li>
            </ul>
            <small>(Donations after paypal fee)</small><br />
            <br>
            So in the current year there are <b>48,12 $</b> donations in total. Calculated with the montly costs this donations
            covers 33% of it's monthly cost.<br />
            <br />
            Every day this project needs more resources of CPU/RAM and Storage (you guys are awesome - this shows me that this project runs and is usefull for you).<br/>
            I will try to get the remaining 77% in with ads.<br />
            <br />
            If you don't donate (which is totally fine!) - you may allow ads in your adblock for this site and help too.<br />
            I hope you understand why i running now ads on this site - if you like to give feedback - tweet me on twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/racecore" target="_blank">@racecore</a><br />
            <br /><br />
            I would like to thank all of you - using this tool / make video tutorials on youtube / suggest on forums.
